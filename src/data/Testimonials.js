      testimonial:
        "Mark has been coaching me for almost 2 years now, pretty much since I first started my lifting journey and I can honestly say there's no way I would've made it this far without him. Over the past year and a half he has helped push me to become better not just physically but mentally and I really can't thank him enough for that. His ability to create mesocycles and splits is extremely impressive, and even before he was a certified personal trainer he was no doubt better than most out there. Soon Mark will help compete in my first bodybuilding show and I wouldn't want any other person to coach me for this. I strongly recommended taking him in as your personal trainer, he is top tier",

      testimonial:
        "When I first started going to the gym, I was doing what I thought at the moment were hard reps. Never went above that, but on my first session with Mark, he immediately knew I could lift more than what I was already lifting. After my first session, my legs exploded while doing less volume than I had been doing before; so much that I questioned what I had been doing the last four months. After each set you will HATE Mark, but that is only because he will push you to your limits and is confident in the potential you didn't even know you had.",
